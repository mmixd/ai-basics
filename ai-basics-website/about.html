            <h2>About AI Basics</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm an interaction design student passionate about making technology accessible to everyone.</p>
            <p>As I learned more about the world of Artificial Intelligence, I realized how integral it has become in our daily livesâ€”from the way we communicate to how we shop and entertain ourselves. Yet, I noticed that many people without a technical background feel left out of the conversation around AI.</p>
            <p>This website is my thesis project, born out of a desire to bridge that gap. I believe that understanding AI shouldn't require a computer science degree or advanced technical skills. My goal is to present AI concepts in simple, easy-to-understand terms, so that anyone can learn about this transformative technology.</p>
            <p>Whether you're curious about how AI works, concerned about its impact, or just looking to expand your knowledge, I hope this site provides valuable insights and sparks your interest in the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
            <p>Thank you for joining me on this project, and I look forward to exploring AI together!</p>
